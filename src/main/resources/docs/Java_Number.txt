public abstract class Number
extends Object
implements Serializable
The abstract class Number is the superclass of platform classes representing numeric values that are convertible to the primitive types byte, double, float, int, long, and short. The specific semantics of the conversion from the numeric value of a particular Number implementation to a given primitive type is defined by the Number implementation in question. For platform classes, the conversion is often analogous to a narrowing primitive conversion or a widening primitive conversion as defining in The Java™ Language Specification for converting between primitive types. Therefore, conversions may lose information about the overall magnitude of a numeric value, may lose precision, and may even return a result of a different sign than the input. See the documentation of a given Number implementation for conversion details.
